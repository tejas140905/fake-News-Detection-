# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning model that classifies news articles as either **fake** or **real** based on their content. The model is trained using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and evaluated using various machine learning algorithms.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms.
  - `nltk`: Natural Language Processing.
  - `flask`: Web application deployment.
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Fake News Dataset or any similar dataset.
